# Analysis tool for the API Detector survey

## Requirements

To run the tool, only ruby is required. If you also want to run the tests, you need bundler, too.

## Getting started

Just execute `./analyze <filename>` where `<filename>` is the csv file with all the results.

## Tests

Before you can run any tests, you have to install the required gems using bundler:

    bundle instal

To run the tests, execute

    bundle exec rake
